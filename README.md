The association between COVID19 and individual employment and financial outcomes

Lay summary:
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to large-scale employment disruption, but little is known about the impact on employment for people who caught COVID-19. 

We will compare the differences in employment status, the number of hours worked, and financial circumstances for people who have had COVID-19 or long COVID compared to those who have not. To do this we will use employment and financial data from research studies, in combination self-identified measures and NHS health records on COVID-19 infection and long COVID. Although we have information on COVID-19 infection and long COVID from our research studies, NHS infection data will give us more reliable information about who was infected and when. 

NHS healthcare and hospital records will also tell us how severe people’s infections have been, and how long they have lasted.  

We hope that this study will tell us how COVID-19 and long COVID might influence people’s ability to carry on in work and cope financially. We will share the results with policy makers to guide decisions on how to support people who have been infected by COVID-19 to return to work and financially support their families. This will be important given the large numbers of people who have long COVID."
